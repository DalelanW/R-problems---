###below a function that considers how much recruits ( new population) to be added to each subsequent year (iteration)

ver_logistics <- function(time, parms){    #function and matrix creator
  with(as.list(parms),{
    y <- r * N * (1 - (N/K))   # equation for each iteration of population
    N <- c()                   #new string
      for (i in 1:length(N)){
        grwth <- c(N,sum(y[1:i]))
      }# closed loop

    as.matrix(tibble(time = time, density = N))    # creates the matrix dataset
  }
       )
}
