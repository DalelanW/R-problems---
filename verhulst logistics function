###below a function that considers how much recruits ( new population) to be added to each subsequent year (iteration)

ver_logistics <- function(time, parms){    #function and matrix creator
  with(as.list(parms),{
    y <- r * N * (1 - (N/K))   # equation for each iteration of population
    N <- c()                   #new string
      for (i in 1:length(N)){
        grwth <- c(N,sum(y[1:i]))
      }# closed loop

    as.matrix(tibble(time = time, density = N))    # creates the matrix dataset
  }
       )
}
### paramters
t = seq(2015,2021,1)  # time interval for nearby
N_0 = 134
N = seq(1:7)
N[1] = N_0

## new verhulsts matrix function
output <- ver_logistics(t, parms = list(
  N = N, r = 0.35, K = 350
 )
)
